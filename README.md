## I'm not Australian...What is AFL Tipping?

I'll answer this in two parts:

### AFL

[Australian Rules Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football) is the most popular spectator sport in Australia (debatable depending where you live in Australia). [AFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Football_League) is the highest level of competition for Australian Rules Football.

### Tipping

Tipping in Australia has nothing to do with tipping your waitress! Tipping refers to a competition where (for a particular sport) you choose which teams you think are going to win their respective games for each round (a 'tip'). For each correct 'tip' you receive a point towards your overall score. Usually you would be in a Tipping competition with your friends, family, work colleagues, etc. The person with the most tips at the end of the season is declared the winner.
